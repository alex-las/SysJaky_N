# Account management overview

The `/Account/Manage` page now serves as the unified dashboard for signed-in users.
It combines profile settings, upcoming course visibility, wishlist tracking, company wishlist insights, enrollment downloads, order history, and token redemption into a single location.

Key sections include:

- **Profile** – update login email, phone number, and connect to a company via reference code.
- **Nadcházející kurzy** – list of future course dates with invoice download links when paid.
- **Redeem seat token** – redeem seat tokens allocated to the user.
- **Moje kurzy** – confirmed enrollments with quick links to calendar downloads and term details.
- **Wishlist** – personal course wishlist entries.
- **Wishlist uživatelů firmy** – manager visibility into team wishlist items.
- **Orders** – order history with invoice or QR download actions.

The legacy `/Account/Dashboard` page has been removed; external links targeting it will be redirected to `/Account/Manage`.
